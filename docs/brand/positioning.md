## ENRG realty at a Glance

### About Us

- Operational Q1 2024; Headquartered in Seattle, WA
- Mission: Evolve real estate brokerage by delivering boutique-level service at a virtual scale. ENRG eliminates false choices: high splits or strong support, independence or community, virtual efficiency or personal touch.
- Founded by industry veterans Peter & Erinn Nobel, who built eXp and Real Brokerage from early stage to multi-billion-dollar public companies.
- Combines best-in-class agent economics, culture-at-scale design, and proprietary Master Data Management (MDM) protecting agent data ownership.
- Seed-stage; $1.475M raised; currently raising $4M round.

### What We Do

- Remove recruiting pressure through Connect & Thrive™, Recruiting-as-a-Service (RaaS). Agents refer quality contacts, ENRG's team handles professional recruitment. Build passive revenue without diverting time from production.
- Provide ENRG Boost™, an infinite-level revenue-share program. Competitors cap at 5-7 levels. ENRG agents earn from their entire downline with no limits.
- Enable agent data ownership through our unified MDM infrastructure. Agents truly own their data, with predictive insights delivering a measurable "+1 deal" advantage.
- Equip agents with integrated tools across onboarding, customer relationship management, marketing, training, and compliance for higher productivity.

### Our Market Focus

- Industry consolidation (Rocket/Redfin, Compass/Anywhere) and Zillow expansion, plus post-NAR settlement, are displacing agents at scale. Less than 10% have migrated to virtual, revenue-share, and equity models, creating a massive opportunity for stable alternatives.
- 550,000+ high-producing agents are stuck choosing between strong economics, quality service, and/or culture.
- Primary customers: top producers ($3M+ in sales), boutique brokerages with a pipeline of listings, and multi-state teams needing virtual scale with boutique-level support.
- Licensed and growing across 14 states with rapid expansion planned.

### Ideal Agent Profile

*"ENRG is built for a specific type of agent."*

You're a good fit if:

- You're an active producer who values your time and independence
- You're building a long-term business, not chasing quick commissions
- You want revenue share without recruiting pressure
- You're looking for your last move in real estate
- You want systems that support you, not control you
- You value data ownership and understand its worth
- You're comfortable with technology but want human support when needed

### Our Unique Edge

- Boutique touch at virtual scale. Competitors either sacrifice culture for scale or can't scale culture and service at all. ENRG delivers both without compromise.
- Proprietary MDM technology infrastructure unifies fragmented data sources while providing agents true ownership of their data. AI-driven predictive analytics help agents close at least one additional annual transaction.
- Premium economics with no recruiting pressure. Competitors force agents to recruit to unlock value. ENRG removes this undesirable friction entirely.
- Five-tier production award equity program ENRG SHINE™, and the infinite-level ENRG Boost™, create long-term alignment and ownership opportunities at every growth stage. Agents build long-term wealth, not just annual income.

## Problem & Solution

### The Real Estate Brokerage Gap

**Legacy brokerages' economic models don't align with professional agents' needs**
Traditional brokerage models are outdated, focused on charging fees to a large, unproductive agent count rather than attracting and rewarding top producers.

**Fragmented tech stacks stifle growth and increase risk**
Disconnected platforms lead to data integrity issues, blown timelines, and inconsistent client experiences, which devalue contact databases, compromise repeat business, and erode earning potential.

**Virtual scale or boutique support, but rarely both**
Large virtual brokerages abandon agents with no real support. Boutiques provide culture and support but lack the technology and multi-state reach agents need to scale revenue as their businesses grow.

**Recruiting requirements create undesirable pressure**
Competitor models force agents to constantly recruit to unlock hard-to-reach bonuses, diverting energy from production and accelerating burnout.

### The ENRG Solution

**Best-in-class economics with ownership alignment**
85/15 splits with $20K caps, infinite-level ENRG Boost revenue share (competitors cap at 5-7 levels), and a unique five-tier production awards equity program. Agents earn more, build passive income, and gain ongoing ownership opportunities.

**Unified data ecosystem unlocks "+1 deal" productivity**
MDM infrastructure unifies client, property, and marketing data while ensuring agents have true ownership of their data. AI identifies ready-to-transact prospects and engages them at the optimal time, generating additional opportunities and closed transactions.

**Boutique experience with virtual-scale efficiency**
Personalized onboarding, white-glove support, culture you can feel, and dedicated operations delivered at a national scale. Virtual brokerages promise this. ENRG delivers it.

**Connect & Thrive™**
Agents refer quality contacts. ENRG's team handles recruitment. Build infinite-level revenue share without managing downlines or sacrificing production time.

### Total Addressable Market (TAM): $120B+
**U.S. Residential Real Estate Commission Pool**

- The U.S. residential market represents $1.65T in annual transaction volume.
- With an average commission rate of 5–6%, this represents an annual commission pool of $100B–$120B accessible to brokerages and agents.
- ENRG's virtual business model is well-positioned to capture market share rapidly, thanks to low overhead, national reach, and attractive agent economics.

### Serviceable Available Market (SAM): $52B
**Experienced-Agent Segment Using Modern Brokerage Models**

- Less than 10% of agents currently participate in revenue-share + equity brokerage models (eXp, Real, LPT, Epique).
- These models target experienced agents producing $3.8M+ per year, representing a market of ~550,000+ agents in the U.S.
- Applying agent GCI averages, this segment represents $52B+ in annual revenue opportunity for modern, tech-enabled brokerages.
- Sources: industry benchmarks; brokerage filings.

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $78M
**ENRG's Near-Term Reach**

- ENRG targets experienced agents and boutique brokerages that are abandoning legacy models due to inadequate economics, cultural gaps, and post-NAR pressure.
- Targeting 1% penetration of the SOM over 5 years (~5500 agents) yields $522M in annual GCI to the brokerage.
- Based on ENRG's commission structure and revenue-share dynamics, this equals an obtainable $78M annual revenue capture.
- ENRG's white-label program and strategic brokerage onboarding with active listings accelerate this trajectory beyond typical single-agent recruitment models.

**Four Wealth Streams**
Agents build wealth through four compounding streams:

| # | Stream | Tagline |

This is a boutique service at a virtual scale.

**Proprietary Agent-Centric Data Moat**
