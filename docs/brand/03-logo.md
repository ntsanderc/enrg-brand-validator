## The Complete Logo System

ENRG has two logos and three wordmark variants:

| Asset | File Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **ENRG Logo** | `primary_logo-*` | Stacked E N R G in square | Socials, profile pics, primary brand mark |
| **ENRG Symbol** | `secondary_logo-*` | E bars with dot | Signs, design accents, geometric patterns |
| **Wordmark (Full)** | `wordmark-*` | ENRG.realty with dot | Primary text identity, formal usage |
| **Wordmark (Short)** | `short_wordmark-*` | ENRG realty, no dot | When dot feels cluttered |
| **Wordmark (Tiny)** | `tiny_wordmark-*` | Just ENRG | Minimal space, stacked layouts |

---

## ENRG Logo (Primary)

The ENRG Logo is our primary brand mark — a stacked arrangement of the letters E N R G in a square format. This is our most essential visual asset for social media, profile pictures, and situations requiring a compact, recognizable brand mark.

**Ideal for:**
- Social media profile pictures and avatars
- App icons and favicons
- Situations requiring a square format
- Primary brand mark placement

The ENRG Logo must always remain unaltered. It should never be modified, redrawn, distorted, or misused in any way.

## ENRG Symbol (Secondary)

The ENRG Symbol is a distinctive geometric representation of our brand identity. It consists of three horizontal bars that form the letter "E" with a dot, symbolizing:

- **Energy**
- **Evolution**
- **Elevated**

These bars are clean and modern, conveying our commitment to progress and innovation.

**Symbol Usage:**
- Signs and environmental branding
- Design accents and geometric patterns
- Subtle branding on merchandise or promotional items

When used independently, the ENRG Symbol maintains its strength and integrity, serving as a bold yet minimalistic representation of the ENRG brand.

## Wordmarks

The wordmarks are the text-based representations of the ENRG brand name. Three variants exist for different contexts:

| Variant | Text | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Wordmark (Full)** | ENRG.realty | Primary text identity, formal usage, official materials |
| **Wordmark (Short)** | ENRG realty | When the dot feels cluttered or in flowing text |
| **Wordmark (Tiny)** | ENRG | Minimal space, stacked with other elements |

### The "Dot" Element

The dot in "ENRG.realty" is a key brand element. It separates "ENRG" and "realty" and reinforces balance, precision, and clarity.

- **In wordmark files:** The dot is rendered in the same color as the text (black or white)
- **As a brand accent:** The dot appears in orange (#FF6039) when used decoratively
- The orange dot signals "this is ENRG" rather than "click here"

**Wordmark Typography:** The "realty" portion uses **Helvetica Neue LT Std**.

## Color Options

All logos and wordmarks are available in these color configurations:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Black on White** | Primary color option. Use in most applications for maximum clarity. |
| **White on Purple** | Purple 500 (#6021E6) background. Ideal for branded materials. |
| **White on Black** | Bold, high-contrast. Sleek, modern look for print and digital. |
| **Black/White Transparent** | For overlays on imagery with sufficient contrast. |

> **Logo Purple:** The official purple for logo backgrounds is Purple 500 (`#6021E6`).

## Minimum Sizes

| Asset | Digital | Print |
|-------|---------|-------|
| ENRG Logo | 60px height | 30mm |
| ENRG Symbol | 80px width | 8mm |

---

## Exclusion Zone

To ensure legibility and impact, all brand marks must maintain sufficient space around them. The exclusion zone is equal to the height of the mark.

```
Exclusion zone = height of the wordmark OR half the height of the symbol
```

---

## Approved Placement

Logos and wordmarks can only be placed in one of five approved locations:

1. Top left corner
2. Top right corner
3. Centered
4. Bottom left corner
5. Bottom right corner

Always respect the logo's exclusion zone when placing it near edges or other elements.

---

## Logo Misuse

The logo should not be misinterpreted, modified, or added to. No attempt should be made to alter the logo in any way. Its orientation, color and composition should remain as indicated—there are no exceptions.

**Do NOT:**
- Bevel or emboss
- Stretch or distort
- Outline the logo
- Add a drop shadow
- Add gradient fill
- Rearrange elements
- Rotate the logo
- Multiply
- Place in a holding shape
- Use unapproved colors
- Lock-up text to the logo
- Change the relationship of components
