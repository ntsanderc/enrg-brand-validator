## Co-Branding Guidelines

### Logo Relationship

When co-branding is required:

| Context | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **Legal documents** | "Indie Brand, affiliated with ENRG Realty" |
| **Marketing materials** | Indie brand primary, ENRG secondary or "Powered by" |
| **Signage** | Per state requirements and Indie agreement |

### "Powered by ENRG" Lockup

For situations requiring ENRG association:

- Indie brand logo appears at primary size
- "Powered by ENRG" or ENRG symbol appears at secondary size
- Clear visual separation between brand elements
- Respect exclusion zones for both marks

> **Note:** Specific lockup artwork is in development. See Roadmap.

## Color Flexibility

Indie Brands may use their own color palette for primary brand materials while incorporating ENRG purple for:

- Affiliate badges or seals
- "Powered by" elements
- Compliance documentation
- ENRG-specific program materials (Boost, SHINE, Connect & Thrive)

---

## Typography Flexibility

Indie Brands may use their own typography for their primary identity while using ENRG typography for:
