## AI Enhancement Standards

### Enhancement Level

**Subtle Enhancement (Recommended):**
- Light skin smoothing (reduce blemishes, not remove texture)
- Color correction for even skin tones
- Eye brightness enhancement
- Hair tidying (flyaways, smoothing)
- Background replacement with approved ENRG backgrounds

**What NOT to Enhance:**
- Do not alter facial structure or proportions
- Do not whiten teeth to unnatural levels
- Do not change eye color
- Do not add makeup digitally
- Do not slim or reshape body

### Before/After Examples

**Example 1: Soft Lavender Background**
- **Before:** Natural outdoor photo, uneven lighting, busy background
- **After:** Even studio-quality lighting, Soft Lavender background, natural skin texture preserved, flyaways smoothed

**Example 2: Gradient Depth Background**
- **Before:** Conference room photo with cluttered background, overhead fluorescent lighting
- **After:** Warm flattering light, Gradient Depth background, professional appearance without looking artificial

**Example 3: Midnight Violet Background**
- **Before:** Home office photo, window light creating harsh shadows
- **After:** Balanced lighting, Midnight Violet background, executive presence, skin texture retained
