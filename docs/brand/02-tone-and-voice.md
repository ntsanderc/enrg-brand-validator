# ENRG Tone and Voice

> **Audience:** Writers, marketers, and anyone creating ENRG content or communications.

How we talk about ENRG — messaging patterns, vocabulary, and anti-patterns.

---

## Core Voice

**Empathetic + Direct**

We acknowledge the real challenges agents face, then offer concrete solutions with specific numbers. No corporate speak, no empty promises.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "It's a Challenging Market. We're Here to Help." | "We're the industry leader in agent empowerment." |
| "At $305K GCI, you're giving Side ~$36K/year that never caps." | "Significant savings potential with our competitive model." |
| "Competitors cap at 5-7 levels. ENRG has no limits." | "We offer unlimited earning potential." |

---

## Messaging Patterns

### Three-Part Rhythm

Statements that land in threes — memorable, balanced, complete.

| Example |
|---------|
| "Boutique support - Virtual freedom - National power." |
| "High splits or strong support, independence or community, virtual efficiency or personal touch." |
| "Earn more, build passive income, and gain ongoing ownership opportunities." |

### Both/And Positioning

The phrase "both/and" is central to ENRG's positioning. Use it explicitly.

| Example |
|---------|
| "The both/and brokerage. Where you don't sacrifice one thing to get another." |
| "Stop Choosing. Start Having It All." |
| "Most brokerages force you to choose: Boutique OR Virtual. Support OR Independence. We reject that false choice." |

**Comparison Framework:**

| Industry Standard | At ENRG You Get |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Boutique Service **OR** Virtual Freedom | Boutique support **with** virtual freedom |
| High Splits **OR** Strong Support | High splits **with** strong support |
| Income Today **OR** Wealth Tomorrow | Income today **with** wealth tomorrow |

### Two-Part Messaging

Parallel structures that create balance and contrast.

| Example |
|---------|
| "Help when you need it. Freedom when you want it." |
| "Keep Your Brand. Gain Our Infrastructure." |
| "National Reach. Local Expertise." |
| "Team Up. Scale Up." |
| "Premium without pretension. Confidence without arrogance." |

### False Choice Framing

Position ENRG as eliminating the tradeoffs competitors force.

| Example |
|---------|
| "ENRG eliminates false choices: high splits or strong support, independence or community." |
| "Virtual brokerages promise boutique support. ENRG delivers it." |
| "Large brokerages sacrifice culture for scale. Boutiques can't scale culture at all. ENRG does both." |

### Problem/Solution Structure

State the pain clearly, then the ENRG solution.

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Legacy brokerages' economic models don't align with professional agents' needs." | "85/15 splits with $20K caps. Agents earn more." |
| "Recruiting requirements create undesirable pressure." | "Connect & Thrive — agents refer, ENRG recruits." |
| "Fragmented tech stacks stifle growth." | "Unified MDM infrastructure delivers '+1 deal' advantage." |

---

## Specificity Rules

### Always Use Exact Numbers

Never round, never hedge. Specificity creates credibility.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "$20K cap" | "Low cap" |
| "85/15 split" | "Competitive split" |
| "$1.475M raised" | "Well-funded" |
| "550,000+ high-producing agents" | "Many agents" |
| "161% agent growth" | "Significant growth" |

### Name the Competition

Direct comparison is acceptable — even encouraged.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Competitors cap at 5-7 levels. ENRG has no limits." | "Other brokerages have limited levels." |
| "eXp requires FLQAs. ENRG doesn't." | "Some brokerages have recruiting requirements." |
| "Side has no equity program. ENRG has five-tier SHINE." | "Unlike some platforms, we offer equity." |

---

## Trademark Usage

Always include TM on first use in a document. Subsequent uses can drop TM.

| Program | First Use | Subsequent |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Connect & Thrive | Connect & Thrive™ | Connect & Thrive |
| ENRG Boost | ENRG Boost™ | ENRG Boost, Boost |
| ENRG SHINE | ENRG SHINE™ | ENRG SHINE, SHINE |

---

## Vocabulary Preferences

| Preferred | Avoid |
|-----------|-------|
| "infinite-level" | "unlimited" (too generic) |
| "boutique at scale" | "personalized service" (overused) |
| "+1 deal advantage" | "better outcomes" (vague) |
| "revenue share" | "rev share" (in formal docs) |
| "data ownership" | "data portability" (weaker) |
| "production-based equity" | "stock options" (not accurate) |
| "no recruiting pressure" | "optional recruiting" (misses the point) |

---

## Memorable Shorthand

These phrases encapsulate complex value props. Use them consistently.

| Shorthand | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| "+1 deal" | MDM data advantage that closes one additional transaction annually |
| "boutique at scale" | Personalized support + national infrastructure |
| "false choices" | Tradeoffs competitors force that ENRG eliminates |
| "infinite-level" | ENRG Boost revenue share with no tier cap |
| "culture you can feel" | Tangible agent experience, not marketing fluff |

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Never Use

| Anti-Pattern | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| Emoji | Use icons or symbols instead. See `.cursorrules`. |
| "Industry leader" | Empty superlative. Everyone claims it. |
| "Best-in-class" without proof | Only use with specific numbers (e.g., "85/15 split") |
| "Synergy", "leverage", "paradigm" | Corporate jargon. Be direct. |
| Passive voice | "Agents are supported by ENRG" -> "ENRG supports agents" |
| Hedging words | "Potentially", "may", "could" — be definitive |

### Avoid in Summaries

| Avoid | Better |
|-------|--------|
| "John is a successful agent with strong production." | "Tampa native who was Agent of the Year three years running before launching his own brand." |
| "May be paying high fees." | "Uncapped Side split eating $36K/year with no equity." |
| "SHINE offers equity opportunities." | "SHINE — ownership stake Side doesn't offer. He built a brand, now build equity." |

---

## Examples: Good vs Bad

### Summary

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "John is a successful Tampa-based real estate agent with over 16 years of experience and strong production numbers." | "Tampa native and 16-year veteran who was Florida Executive Realty's Agent of the Year three years running before launching Westward Real Estate as a Side affiliate." |

### Pain Points

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "May be paying high fees to current brokerage" | "Uncapped Side split eating into margins — at $305K GCI, paying ~$36K/yr with no equity" |
| "Limited growth potential" | "Solo operator ceiling — no leverage beyond his own production" |

### Why ENRG

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "SHINE offers equity opportunities" | "SHINE — Ownership stake Side doesn't offer. He built a brand, now build equity." |
| "Better economics than current model" | "At $305K GCI, he's giving Side ~$36K/year that never caps. ENRG's $20K cap + fees = ~$28K — that's $8K+ back PLUS SHINE equity." |
