# Roadmap Content Audit

> **Purpose:** Verify alignment between roadmap task claims (Index.html) and actual brand documentation status.
> **Date:** January 19, 2026
> **Auditor:** Comprehensive automated review

---

## Executive Summary

### Current Roadmap Status (What It Claims)

The ENRG Brand Validator roadmap presents **10 major content areas** with **54 total tasks** across various sections. The roadmap currently shows:

- **Progress Counter:** Displays percentage of completed tasks
- **Task Status:** Some tasks marked as "done" (green checkmark), most remain as "TBD"
- **Visual Indicators:** "TBD" badges on navigation items for incomplete sections

### Actual Content Status (What Exists)

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The roadmap significantly **undersells the actual completion status**. Five key brand documentation files exist and are **comprehensive, production-ready documents**:

| Document | Status | Roadmap Claim |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| `09-headshot-standards.md` | ✅ **COMPLETE** (277 lines) | "TBD" |
| `10-email-signatures.md` | ✅ **COMPLETE** (448 lines) | "TBD" |
| `11-sub-brands.md` | ✅ **COMPLETE** (499 lines) | "TBD" |
| `12-photography-stock.md` | ✅ **COMPLETE** (370 lines) | "TBD" |
| `13-data-visualization.md` | ✅ **COMPLETE** (532 lines) | "TBD" |

### Gap Analysis

**The Problem:** The roadmap's task tracking system is completely out of sync with the actual content. Nearly **all 24 tasks** across these five sections are marked as incomplete in the roadmap, despite having comprehensive documentation files that address **every single requirement**.

**Impact:**
- Users are misled about documentation completeness
- Progress counter is artificially deflated
- Substantial documentation work is invisible
- "TBD" badges create false impression of missing content

**Opportunity:** Updating task statuses would immediately shift the roadmap from appearing ~16% complete to **~60-70% complete** for these sections alone.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

#### 1. Update Task Status in Index.html

**Action:** Add `class="done"` to all 22 task checkboxes in the following data-task IDs:

**Headshot Standards:**
- `headshot-1`, `headshot-2`, `headshot-3`, `headshot-4`, `headshot-5`

**Email Signatures:**
- `email-1`, `email-2`, `email-3`, `email-4`

**Sub-brands:**
- `subbrand-1`, `subbrand-2`, `subbrand-3`, `subbrand-4`, `subbrand-5`

**Photography:**
- `photo-1`, `photo-2`, `photo-3`, `photo-4`

**Data Visualization:**
- `dataviz-1`, `dataviz-2`, `dataviz-3`, `dataviz-4`

**Example Fix:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<span class="todo-checkbox" data-task="headshot-1" onclick="toggleTodo(this)">

<!-- AFTER -->
<span class="todo-checkbox done" data-task="headshot-1" onclick="toggleTodo(this)">
```

#### 2. Remove "TBD" Navigation Badges

**Action:** Remove `class="nav-tbd"` from navigation links for completed sections:

**Lines to Update (approximate):**
- Line 1603: `Headshot Standards` link
- Line 1604: `Email Signatures` link
- Line 1605: `Photography` link
- Line 1606: `Sub-brands` link
- Line 1611: `Data Visualization` link

**Example Fix:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<a href="#roadmap" onclick="..." class="nav-tbd">Headshot Standards</a>

<!-- AFTER -->
<a href="#roadmap" onclick="...">Headshot Standards</a>
```

#### 3. Update Progress Counter Logic

**Action:** Verify the JavaScript progress calculation includes these 22 completed tasks. The progress counter should automatically update once task statuses are changed.

**Current Issue:** Progress counter likely shows ~16% (9 doc tasks done out of ~54 total)

**After Fix:** Progress counter should show ~57% (31 tasks done: 9 doc + 22 content tasks)

#### 4. Add Documentation Links to Roadmap Cards

**Action:** Add links to actual `.md` files in each roadmap card's header or body:

**Example Addition:**
```html
<div class="expand-card-desc">
  AI headshot system backgrounds, poses, attire guidelines, and roster image specifications.
  <a href="../../../docs/core/brand/09-headshot-standards.md" style="color: var(--purple-primary); font-weight: 600;">→ View Documentation</a>
</div>
```

### Content Enhancements

#### 1. Visual Assets Still Needed

While documentation is complete, some sections reference assets that may need creation:

**Headshot Standards:**
- Visual before/after comparison images (currently described in text)
- Background sample images (Midnight Violet, Soft Lavender, etc.)

**Email Signatures:**
- Logo files referenced in signature HTML (`logo-small.png`, `logo-white.png`)
- Social icon images for newsletter footer

**Sub-brands:**
- Actual logo artwork files (SVG/PNG) for Boost, SHINE, Connect & Thrive
- Level badges and tier icons as downloadable assets
- Gem icons for SHINE tiers

**Photography:**
- Example gallery (on-brand vs. off-brand images side-by-side)
- Lightroom preset files (.xmp or .lrtemplate)

**Data Visualization:**
- Template files for Google Sheets, Excel, Figma
- Chart.js configuration snippets

**Recommendation:** Create new roadmap section "Asset Creation" to track these visual deliverables separately from documentation.

#### 2. Cross-Reference Validation

**Action:** Verify all internal links in the brand docs point to correct files:

Example from `09-headshot-standards.md`:
```markdown
- [Colors](./04-colors.md) — Purple palette used in backgrounds
- [Applications](./08-applications.md) — Usage in marketing materials
- [Design System](./07-design-system.md) — UI components for roster cards
```

Ensure these files exist at the referenced paths.

#### 3. Add "Last Updated" Automation

**Action:** Consider adding a script to auto-update "Last Updated" dates in documentation headers when files are modified.

### Process Improvements

#### 1. Sync Mechanism

**Problem:** Manual task tracking in HTML is error-prone and creates drift.

**Solution Options:**
- **Option A:** Generate roadmap cards from `.md` file frontmatter (YAML headers)
- **Option B:** Use GitHub Actions to auto-check `.md` file existence and update task status
- **Option C:** Create a validation script that compares roadmap tasks to actual file content

#### 2. Documentation Standard

**Action:** Create a template for new brand documentation files to ensure consistency:

```markdown
# [Topic Name]

> **Audience:** [Who should read this]

*Last Updated: [Month Year]*

---

## Overview

[Brief description]

**Key Principle:** [One-sentence guiding principle]

---

[Content sections]

---

## Related Documents

- [Link to related doc 1]
- [Link to related doc 2]

---

*ENRG.realty*
```

**Note:** All 5 audited files already follow this template perfectly.

#### 3. QC Checklist Before Roadmap Updates

Before marking any roadmap task as "done":

- [ ] Documentation file exists and is accessible
- [ ] Content directly addresses the task requirement
- [ ] Examples, code snippets, or tables are included (not just prose)
- [ ] Cross-references to related docs are present
- [ ] File follows ENRG documentation template
- [ ] "Last Updated" date is current
- [ ] File is committed to version control
- [ ] Link from roadmap to documentation works

---

## Conclusion

**Primary Finding:** Five major brand documentation sections (Headshot Standards, Email Signatures, Sub-brands, Photography, Data Visualization) are **100% complete** with comprehensive, production-ready documentation totaling **2,126 lines** of detailed guidelines, code examples, and specifications.

**Critical Issue:** The roadmap's task tracking is completely out of sync, showing 0/22 tasks complete when all 22 are actually done. This creates a false impression of missing content and severely understates the brand documentation's maturity.

**Impact of Recommended Updates:**
- Progress visibility increases from ~16% to ~57%
- User confidence in documentation completeness improves dramatically
- "TBD" stigma removed from five major navigation items
- Actual state matches perceived state

**Next Steps:**
1. Update Index.html with 22 task status changes (estimated 30 minutes)
2. Remove 5 "TBD" navigation badges (estimated 5 minutes)
3. Add documentation links to roadmap cards (estimated 15 minutes)
4. Validate progress counter updates correctly (estimated 10 minutes)

**Total Effort:** ~1 hour to achieve accurate roadmap representation.
